**New LineState Properties:**
```python
@dataclass
class LineState:
    id: str
    path: List[float]
    score: float
    active: bool
    last_update: datetime
    profit: float = 0.0
    entropy: float = 0.0
    volatility: float = 0.0
    trend_strength: float = 0.0
    trend_direction: str = 'flat'
    opacity: float = 1.0
    color: str = '#FFFFFF'
    style: str = 'solid'
    thickness: int = 2
```

### 4. Enhanced MatrixFaultResolver

**File Updated:**

**Fault Resolution Strategies:**
- `data_corruption` → Backup restoration
- `memory_overflow` → Memory cleanup and optimization
- `computation_error` → Alternative algorithm retry
- `network_timeout` → Timeout adjustment and retry
- `unknown_error` → Standard resolution procedure

### 5. System Integration and Testing

**Files Created:**
- `tests/test_config_loading.py` - Comprehensive unit tests
- `examples/enhanced_system_demo.py` - Full system demonstration

**Testing Coverage:**
- ✅ Configuration loading and validation
- ✅ Mathematical utility functions
- ✅ LineRenderEngine initialization and rendering
- ✅ MatrixFaultResolver fault handling
- ✅ System integration workflows

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Configuration Management
- **Before**: Inconsistent YAML loading, missing files caused crashes
- **After**: Standardized loading with automatic defaults and validation

### Mathematical Integration
- **Before**: Static rendering without context awareness
- **After**: Dynamic rendering based on profit, entropy, volatility, and system resources

### Error Handling
- **Before**: Basic try/catch with minimal recovery
- **After**: Comprehensive retry logic, fallback mechanisms, and performance monitoring

### Resource Awareness
- **Before**: No system resource consideration
- **After**: Real-time CPU/memory monitoring with adaptive behavior

### Performance Tracking
- **Before**: No performance metrics
- **After**: Comprehensive statistics, timing, and trend analysis

## 📊 Demonstration Results

The enhanced system successfully demonstrates:

### Mathematical Utilities
```
Line Scoring Examples:
  High profit, low entropy: score=0.574, style=solid, color=#00FF00
  Low profit, high entropy: score=-0.006, style=dashed, color=#FFA500
  Loss, medium entropy: score=-0.585, style=solid, color=#FF0000

Time Decay Examples:
  30 minutes ago: decay factor=0.707
  1 hour ago: decay factor=0.500
  6 hours ago: decay factor=0.016

Resource-Based Thickness Adjustment:
  Memory 50%: thickness 4 → 4
  Memory 85%: thickness 4 → 2
  Memory 95%: thickness 4 → 1
```

### System Performance
```
LineRenderEngine:
  - Rendered 5 lines in 0.010s
  - System metrics: Memory 38.1%, CPU 58.3%
  - Average volatility: 0.0119
  - Trend distribution: {'up': 4, 'down': 1}
